# MIAPTE
 The Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE) reporting guidelines is an OME-XML compatible metadata definition standard we hope will facilitate the sharing and dissemination of results obtained from Multiple Particle Tracking (MPT) experiments. Specifically, we hope that MIAPTE will contribute to make data produced in MPT experiments FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable). For our purposes, MPT is defined as described by Chenouard et al. 2014. MIAPTE conforms to the criteria posited by Taylor et al. 2008 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1411) and currently maintained by the Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) foundry. MIAPTE can also be seen as an extension of the OME-XML data model in that elements, attributes and types defined in that model are re-used here when appropriate to avoid "reinventing the wheel". The current version of the model should be intended as a Request for Comments type of publication. Any member of the scientific or developer community is invited to collaborate with us to help us to modify, extend, improve the model.
